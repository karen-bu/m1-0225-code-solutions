## Quiz Questions

Answer the following questions in the provided markdown file before turning in this exercise:

- How do block-level elements affect the document flow?
  Block-level elements start on a new line and stretch out to the full width available. So they affect the document's flow because they have to be contained on their own line, and take up a lot of space.

- How do inline elements affect the document flow?
  Inline elements occupy only the space bounded by the tags defining the element. They affect the document's flow less as they do not have to start on their own line, and do not take up a lot of space.

- What are the default width and height of a block-level element?
  The default width of a block-level element is the entire width of the page, and the default height of a block-level element is the height of its contents.

- What are the default width and height of an inline element?
  The default width of an inline element is as it is defined by the tags defining it, and the default width is as wide as the element it contains (i.e. the length of the text, image, etc.)
