## Quiz Questions

Answer the following questions in the provided markdown file before turning in this exercise:

- What is the `<dialog>` element used for?
  The `<dialogue>` element is used to create pop-up windows on a webpage without the need for JavaScript libraries.

- How do you display a modal dialog?
  To display a modal dialogue you can use the `show()` or `showModal()` method of a DOM element.

- How do you hide a modal dialog?
  To hide a modal dialogue you use the `close()` method of a DOM element.

- What is the difference between the `showModal` & `show` methods?
  The difference between `showModal()` and `show()` is that `showModal()` blocks interaction with the rest of the webpage (i.e. you need to interact with the modal to move on or get back to the main page) and `show()` only displays a dialogue box and does not block interaction with the rest of the page.
