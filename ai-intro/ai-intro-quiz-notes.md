## Quiz Questions

Answer the following questions in the provided markdown file before turning in this exercise:

- Will AI replace software developers? (Human Answer)
  It is highly unlikely that AI will replace software developers entirely. Because AI relies on prediction and learns from previous data, it cannot be 100% correct all the time particularly in novel situations. However, AI tools can enhance coding productivity, so it is likely that coders who do not use AI ill be less productive/useful to capitalism and therefore will be replaced.

- What is the best way to use AI tools when learning software development? (Human Answer)
  Human answer: It is best to ask questions to deeper understand syntax, purpose of code, concepts, and approaches. You can also use it to quiz yourself or identify syntax or compiler errors. It should NOT be asked to generate code or find bugs.

- What is the danger of using AI tools for software development while I'm still learning? (Human Answer)
  You run the risk of using it as a crutch for the easy answer instead of actually developing a deep understanding of the material. Problem solving is the primary superpower of coders, and having AI or an LLM do the problem solving for you means you will never develop that muscle.

- ChatGPT-generated answers below. (Human) Observations: ChatGPT is so wordy. It gives a LOT of information, which is actually sometimes good information and has viewpoints and examples I did not consider, but also it's a lot to sift through. Sometimes I feel like it's being wordy just for the sake of being wordy, and it can say more with less. I personally prefer a more concise communication style. It also keeps trying to pitch itself as a tool to enhance human productivity and creativity and not replace it entirely, which I feel like is a lesson more people can internalize because over-reliance on ChatGPT and AI is so obvious in this world. It also keeps trying to engage me in conversation by asking me questions back. That's my least favorite part. I don't want a conversation ... a dictionary or Wikipedia never asks me about my day and I like that just fine lol.

- Will AI replace software developers? (ChatGPT Answer)
  ChatGPT answer: AI is definitely making strides in software development, but it's not likely to fully replace software developers anytime soon. The role of a developer goes beyond just writing code. It involves problem-solving, understanding user needs, collaborating with teams, and thinking creatively to come up with solutions that work in the real world. AI tools like code generators, refactoring assistants, and even tools for debugging are already being used to speed up development, but they're more about augmenting developers' work than replacing them entirely. It’s like having a powerful assistant that handles repetitive tasks or suggests solutions but still relies on human expertise for the nuanced, higher-level decision-making. Developers will probably spend less time on the mundane parts of coding and more on designing, problem-solving, and understanding the bigger picture. In short, AI might change the way developers work, but the need for human creativity, judgment, and collaboration in building software is still essential. What do you think—are you worried about AI taking over in the dev world?

- What is the best way to use AI tools when learning software development? (ChatGPT Answer)

  1. Code Assistance & Debugging
     Start with AI-driven code completion tools like GitHub Copilot or Tabnine. These tools can help you by suggesting code snippets or completing lines based on what you're trying to build. It’s a great way to learn the syntax and structures of the language you're working with.
     Debugging with AI: If you encounter errors, tools like DeepCode or even AI-based linters can help you spot mistakes and suggest corrections, giving you instant feedback, which is invaluable when you’re learning.
  2. Understand Code, Don’t Just Copy-Paste
     When using AI tools for code suggestions, don’t just copy-paste the code. Take the time to understand why the AI is suggesting what it is. Break down the solution, see how it works, and try to learn the logic behind it. AI tools can help you speed up the learning process, but the real value comes from comprehension.
  3. Ask for Explanations
     Some AI tools can explain code or concepts (like ChatGPT or even specific tools designed for that, e.g., Explain Code). If you’re learning a new concept or don’t understand a specific part of code, you can ask these tools for clarifications or explanations. They can help break down complex ideas into digestible parts.
  4. Generate Practice Problems & Exercises
     AI can help generate coding problems or challenges at different levels, from beginner to advanced. Use tools like Leetcode, Exercism, or even ChatGPT to come up with coding exercises. You can use them to practice and then have the AI help with solutions or explanations if you get stuck.
  5. Pair Programming with AI
     Some developers use AI as a sort of virtual "pair programming" partner. You can write some code, and the AI can suggest optimizations, point out bugs, or provide alternative solutions. It’s a good way to bounce ideas and get immediate feedback.
  6. Research & Learn Concepts
     Use AI-powered tools like ChatGPT to quickly look up and clarify programming concepts. For example, if you're learning about object-oriented programming, you can ask AI to explain concepts like inheritance, polymorphism, etc. This can be a faster way to get insights than traditional documentation or forums.
  7. AI for Reviewing & Improving Code
     Once you write a piece of code, you can run it through tools like Codex or SonarQube for a review. They can help you identify weaknesses in your code (e.g., performance issues, poor readability) and suggest ways to improve it. It’s like having an experienced mentor review your work.
  8. AI-Assisted Learning Pathways
     AI tools can sometimes offer a structured learning path based on your current knowledge level. For instance, platforms like Exercism or EdX can tailor learning recommendations based on your progress and areas where you need improvement.
  9. Stay Informed
     AI tools can help you stay up-to-date with the latest trends, libraries, or technologies in software development. For example, they can recommend reading materials, tutorials, or even recent blog posts about new frameworks or tools you might want to learn.
  10. Enhance Your Soft Skills
      While AI can’t replace the need for collaboration and communication skills, it can help you focus on your technical growth, so you can spend more time working on soft skills that are equally important for developers. Tools like AI-powered chatbots or virtual assistants can simulate collaboration environments where you practice articulating your thoughts.
      Summary:
      Complement your learning: Use AI tools to streamline tasks like debugging, code completion, or generating examples, but don’t let them do all the work.
      Learn actively: Engage with the suggestions AI gives you by understanding the code and experimenting with variations.
      Ask questions: Use AI tools for clarifications and explanations of concepts that seem unclear.
      By doing this, you’ll leverage the power of AI without losing the essence of learning and improving your skills. How do you usually approach learning development? Are there specific areas you’re struggling with that AI could help with?

- What is the danger of using AI tools for software development while I'm still learning? (ChatGPT Answer)

  1. Over-reliance on AI
     Danger: If you rely too heavily on AI for code generation, debugging, or problem-solving, you might skip the deeper learning process. It's tempting to let AI write most of the code for you, but this can hinder your understanding of underlying concepts, algorithms, and problem-solving techniques.
     How to Avoid: Use AI as a supplement to your learning, not a crutch. Try to write the code yourself first, and only consult AI when you're stuck or need assistance. Challenge yourself to understand why a solution works.
  2. Shallow Understanding of Concepts
     Danger: AI tools can often provide quick answers, but if you're not careful, you might only gain a superficial understanding of concepts. For example, if AI writes a solution for you, you might miss out on understanding the why and how behind the logic or data structures being used.
     How to Avoid: Always ask "why". When AI provides you with a solution, take the time to break it down. Research any unfamiliar methods, functions, or patterns in the code to fully understand how they work. Read the documentation and experiment with variations of the code.
  3. Copy-Pasting Without Understanding
     Danger: It’s easy to fall into the trap of copy-pasting code from AI tools without understanding what it does. This might help you solve a problem temporarily, but you won’t build the skills to write your own code or solve similar problems on your own in the future.
     How to Avoid: After copying AI-generated code, go step-by-step through it and try to understand the logic behind each line. Experiment with slight modifications and see how they affect the output.
  4. Missing Out on Problem-Solving Practice
     Danger: Software development is all about problem-solving. If you're letting AI do too much of the heavy lifting, you miss out on honing your critical thinking and problem-solving skills, which are essential for long-term growth as a developer.
     How to Avoid: Set challenges for yourself where you try to solve the problem on your own before turning to AI for help. Even if it takes longer, working through problems on your own helps you build resilience and better understanding.
  5. Overlooking Edge Cases and Best Practices
     Danger: AI tools may offer functional code, but they might not always follow best practices or consider edge cases. Without the experience to recognize this, you might write inefficient or buggy code that doesn't scale well.
     How to Avoid: Read about best practices for the language or framework you're learning. Pay attention to things like code readability, performance optimizations, and common pitfalls. Ask AI tools for feedback, but also learn the principles that go into making code "good" from the start.
  6. Lack of Debugging Skills
     Danger: If you're constantly relying on AI to fix bugs, you might not develop strong debugging skills. Debugging is a core part of software development, and relying too much on AI tools for this might stunt your ability to trace problems in your code and fix them yourself.
     How to Avoid: Try to debug your code manually first, using tools like console logging, breakpoints, or step-through debugging. If you hit a wall, then you can ask AI for suggestions, but always learn from those suggestions.
  7. False Sense of Mastery
     Danger: If you're learning development with the aid of AI tools, you might develop a false sense of mastery because things seem easier than they actually are. You might think you understand a concept because the AI provided an instant solution, but the reality is that you may not truly grasp the intricacies of the problem.
     How to Avoid: Be honest with yourself about what you know. Test your understanding by explaining concepts to others or by teaching someone else. If you can’t explain it simply, you probably haven’t fully grasped it.
  8. Security Risks
     Danger: AI tools sometimes generate code that looks fine but might have security vulnerabilities or be inefficient. Without proper knowledge, you may inadvertently introduce security flaws into your projects.
     How to Avoid: Learn the basics of secure coding practices, especially for the language or framework you're using. AI tools can help, but they should never replace your security awareness.
  9. Missing Soft Skills Development
     Danger: Many AI tools, especially ones for code generation or debugging, might be great for technical tasks but don't help you develop essential soft skills like communication, teamwork, and problem analysis that are equally important for developers.
     How to Avoid: Balance your technical learning with practice in collaborative environments, working with others on projects, and improving your communication skills.
     The Bottom Line:
     AI tools are fantastic, but they shouldn't take the place of active learning. Use them as a support for when you're stuck, or for reviewing code and getting feedback, but always make sure you're learning the fundamentals, practicing problem-solving, and pushing yourself to grow as a developer.

  Do you find yourself leaning on AI tools a lot in your learning process? Or are you already cautious about some of these dangers?
