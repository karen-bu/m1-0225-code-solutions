## Quiz Questions

Answer the following questions in the provided markdown file before turning in this exercise:

- Why do we log things to the console?
  We log things to the console in order to check our code and be able to experiment with it.

- What is a method?
  A method is a function that is attached to an object in the form of a property.

- How is a method different from any other function?
  A method is not really different than any other function except that it is attached to an object as a property.

- How do you remove the last element from an array?
  Use the `pop()` array method

- How do you round a number down to the nearest integer?
  Use the `math.floor()` math method

- How do you generate a random number?
  Use the `math.random()` math method

- How do you delete an element from an array?
  You can use `pop()` to remove the last element, `shift()` to remove the first element, or `splice()` to selectively remove existing elements and add new ones in its place.

- How do you append an element to an array?
  You can use the `push()` method to add an element to the end of an array, or the `unshift()` method to add an element to the beginning of the array. You can also use `splice` to selectively replace elements.

- How do you break a string up into an array?
  You can use the `split()` method.

- Do string methods change the original string? How would you check if you weren't sure?
  String methods do not change the original string. You can check by assigning the original string as a value to a variable and then logging that variable.

- Is the return value of a function or method useful in every situation?
  Outside of the methods that have to return something by default, there is no need to have a `return` in a function so presumably if you include a `return` in a function it has to be useful in some way.

- How do you get a collection of an objects keys?
  You can use the `object.keys()` method

- How do you get a collection of an objects values?
  You can use the `object.values()` method

- How do you get a collection of both an objects keys and values?
  You can use the `object.entries()` method
