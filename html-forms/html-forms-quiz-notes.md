## Quiz Questions

Answer the following questions in the provided markdown file before turning in this exercise:

- What is the purpose of an HTML `form` element?
  The HTML `form` element defines a form and acts as a container for the different inputs for the form.

- Give five examples of form control elements.
  Checkboxes `<input type="checkbox">`, radio buttons `<input type="radio">`, short text `<input>`, long text `<textarea>`, dropdown lists `<select>`.

- Give three examples of `type` attribute values for HTML `<input>` elements.
  `<input type="text>` for a one line short text entry.
  `<input type="checkbox>` for a checkbox
  `<input type="radio>` for a radio button

- Is an HTML `<input>` element a block element or an inline element?
  Input elements are inline block elements, meaning they sit inline with other elements but we can control a set height and width beyond just letting that be dictated by the size of the content.
