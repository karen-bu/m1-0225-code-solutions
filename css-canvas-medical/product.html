            Canvas creates a shared understanding of patient care across
            clinicians, staff, and patients themselves — making you more
            productive, less stressed, and adding just a bit more joy into your
            practice of medicine.

                Canvas pulls everything you need directly into your note, so you
                never have to leave it. And because Canvas learns from every
                interaction, it gets smarter with every patient you see.

                &quot;Which of my uncontrolled diabetic patients haven't had a
                test in the past 3 months? Which of my patients are on
                potentially unsafe levels of opioids according to recent
                guidelines? That doesn't seem like a lot to ask and those are
                tremendously important questions. But I just couldn't get an
                answer from our old system! Canvas is light-years ahead.&quot;

                Clinical quality and revenue cycle reports can help you
                understand performance, but they aren't enough to improve
                quality and increase revenue day after day. Canvas automates
                quality protocols and charge capture so clinicians can focus on
                more complex work only they can do.

                &quot;With MIPS a reality and fee-for-service billing rules as
                complex as ever, to be honest I didn't know we were going to
                keep up. We're a small practice and we don't have a big quality
                team or a group of coders to catch everything. The automation in
                Canvas has completely eliminated my concerns around quality and
                revenue performance.&quot;
