            Our mission is to give clinicians and their teams highly usable,
            intelligent tools to advance their practice of medicine — and
            improve their day-to-day.

          <h1>What We Believe</h1>
          <p>
            Why did we enter this crowded field? Because medical records have
            fallen dramatically short of their promise to improve the quality
            and efficiency of healthcare. Clinicians spend far too long at their
            computers. Workflows are overly restrictive. Valuable medical data
            is left unstructured.
          </p>
          <p>
            We are honored and humbled when a practice chooses us as their
            technology partner. Medicine is a delicate craft that mixes art and
            science — technology can help or hinder this craft. Working with
            clinicians across the country, we think we have begun to build
            something that helps.
