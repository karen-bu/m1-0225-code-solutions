            Becoming a physician will endure as your all-time best investment
            decision, and on behalf of your community, we're grateful for it.
            When you choose to invest in Canvas, we'll ensure you list Canvas as
            the second best investment you've ever made for your practice,
            guaranteed. Contact us when you're ready to discuss the details.

              <p>
                You should only move forward with Canvas if and when you have
                determined that we far outperform other vendors and offer an
                unmatched return on investment. Our goal is to give you as much
                information as possible to make this determination one way or
                the other. We will provide access to a sandbox of the Canvas
                application for you to get a feel for the platform as well as
                references to current customers to talk about their experience.

              </div>
              <p>
                Canvas is meant to integrate with your existing interfaces and
                community resources. At a minimum, this means porting over your
                fax number, enrolling your payers with our clearinghouse, and
                getting bidirectional lab feeds running. We'll also load your
                preferred specialists and imaging centers into Canvas so that
                sending referrals and closing loops is seamless. Finally, if
                interfaces with health information exchanges or other
                information technology vendors are important, we will work with
                you to determine what we can deliver and when.

                You should only move forward with Canvas if and when you have

              <h3>Training and Site Visit</h3>
              <p>
                We will work with you to configure Canvas properly, including
                clinical content, charge schedules, and much more. Role-based
                trainings will be done a few weeks prior to go-live to
                familiarize relevant team members with clinical, practice
                management, and billing workflows. Either before or during
                go-live, one of our team can visit your practice to work
                side-by-side with you on implementation and training.

              <h3>Go-Live and Tuning</h3>
              <p>
                Go-live is when you start using Canvas with real patients in
                your practice. We will be with you, either in-person or remotely
                depending on your preference, to make sure everything goes
                smoothly. There is always fine tuning to do once you have a
                handful of encounters in Canvas under your belt: changing
                clinical microtemplates, setting up new automations, modifying
                practice management settings, and more. We are here to help with
                it all.

              <h3>Sustained Performance</h3>
              <p>
                All EMR contracts should contain assurances against broken
                promises and provide support over the long term. Our Performance
                Warranty means that if we are not meeting expectations, you can
                terminate the agreement and receive all payments back (we do not
                expect this to happen). For our Standard plans, we also offer a
                MIPS guarantee: if you receive a negative adjustment, we will
                cover it. And for everyone we provide unlimited 24/7 support at
                no charge. We expect this to be a long, productive partnership
                for us both.
