- What is the purpose of variables?
  The purpose of a variable is to act as a container to store values of data.

- How do you **declare** a variable?

- How do you initialize (**assign a value to**) a variable?
  To initalize a variable, you use the = equals sign. The declaration and variable name should go to the left of the =, and the value of the declared variable should go to the right of the =/

- What characters are allowed in variable names?
  The characters allowed in variable names are letters, digits, underscores, or dollar signs, but it must start with a letter, an underscore, or a dollar sign. A variable name cannot start with a number.

- What does it mean to say that variable names are "case sensitive"?
  A variable name being 'case sensitive' means that capitalization matters. Variable names that are capitalized differently will be considered a different variable altogether.

  The purpose of a string is to represent text.

- How do you update the value of a variable?
  You can update the value of a variable by assigning it a different value with the `=` operator.

- What is the difference between `null` and `undefined`?
  `Null` intentionally represents 'no value' or 'empty value' and is a value in and of itself. `Undefined` means a variable has been declared but is not yet initialized with a value - it may well have a value in the future, but not at the moment.

- Why is it a good habit to include "labels" when you log values to the browser console?
  It is good to include 'labels' when you log values to the browser console so you can give yourself context as to what is being logged to the console, especially when you are logging a lot of data.
