## Quiz Questions

Answer the following questions in the provided markdown file before turning in this exercise:

- What is the purpose of a loop?
  The purpose of a loop is to execute the same block of code over and over again as long as certain conditions are met.

- What is the purpose of a **condition** expression in a loop?
  The condition expression in a loop determines when the code of the loop itself runs â€“ as long as it evaluates to `true`, the loop will keep running.

- What does "iteration" mean in the context of loops?
  It means one instance of the code being executed.

- _When_ does the **condition** expression of a `while` loop get evaluated?
  The condition expression of a `while` loop is evaluated before each iteration.

- _When_ does the **initialization** expression of a `for` loop get evaluated?
  The initalization expression of a `for` loop gets evaluated before the code itself runs.

- _When_ does the **condition** expression of a `for` loop get evaluated?
  The condition expression of a `for` loop gets evaluated before each iteration of the loop.

- _When_ does the **final** expression of a `for` loop get evaluated?
  The final expression of a for loop is evaluated after each iteration of the loop.

- Besides a `return` statement, which exits its entire function block, which keyword exits a loop before its **condition** expression evaluates to `false`?
  `break` can exit a loop before the condition evaluates to false.

- What does the `++` increment operator do?
  It increases the index value at the end of every loop, so the loop can be re-run.

- How do you iterate through the keys of an object?
  You can use a `for ... in` loop to iterate through the keys of an object.
